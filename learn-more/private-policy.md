## CoinLucks Privacy Policy

Effective Date: December 24, 2024

CoinLucks ("we", "our", "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal information when you use the CoinLucks platform (the "Platform") and interact with our services. As a decentralized platform, we do not collect or store most personal information. However, certain user-provided information such as nicknames, avatars, and linked social accounts (Telegram, Twitter, etc.) are stored on our servers.

By accessing or using the Platform, you agree to the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, you should immediately stop using the Platform.

#### 1. Information We Do Not Collect

CoinLucks operates primarily as a decentralized platform and does not collect or store most personal information. The only information we do not collect directly is sensitive personal data such as your name, email address, or financial data, aside from what is required for blockchain transactions.

1.1 **No Personal Identifiable Information (PII)**\
CoinLucks does not collect personal identifiable information (PII) such as names, email addresses, or phone numbers. The primary data we rely on is your blockchain wallet address for participation in transactions and Platform services.

1.2 **Blockchain Wallet Information**\
When using CoinLucks, only your blockchain wallet address is used for transactions. This information is public and associated with your activity on the Platform, but it is not tied to any personally identifiable information.

#### 2. Information We Collect

While CoinLucks does not collect extensive personal information, users have the ability to set a nickname, upload an avatar, and link social accounts (Telegram, Twitter) for social interaction within the Platform. This data is stored on our servers and used for enhancing the user experience.

2.1 **Nickname and Avatar**\
If you choose to customize your account, you may provide a nickname and upload an avatar. These settings are stored on our servers and used to personalize your experience on the Platform.

2.2 **Social Account Integration**\
CoinLucks allows you to link your social accounts (e.g., Telegram, Twitter) to your profile. This data is stored on our servers and used to facilitate social interactions and integration within the Platform. Please note, CoinLucks does not store your social account login credentials.

2.3 **Transaction Data**\
Blockchain transactions are recorded on the blockchain and may include wallet addresses and transaction history. This data is publicly visible and is not linked to any personal identity, as CoinLucks does not collect or store this information on our servers.

2.4 **Log Data**\
CoinLucks may collect non-personal information, such as IP addresses, device and browser types, access times, and pages visited. This data is used for system maintenance, security, and performance optimization, and is not tied to any personally identifiable information.

#### 3. Use of Information

CoinLucks uses the information collected primarily for the following purposes:

3.1 **Personalization**\
Your nickname, avatar, and social account settings are stored and used to personalize your experience on the Platform. This information allows you to interact socially and engage with other users through social integrations (e.g., Telegram, Twitter).

3.2 **Transaction Verification**\
Transaction data (including wallet addresses) is necessary for verifying purchases, winnings, and any other activities within the Platform. This data is recorded on the blockchain and is visible to all network participants.

3.3 **Platform Improvement**\
We may use aggregated, non-personally identifiable data to improve the functionality, performance, and features of the Platform. This includes analyzing trends, monitoring performance, and troubleshooting issues.

3.4 **Security and Fraud Prevention**\
We may use IP addresses and transaction data to detect and prevent fraudulent activities. This helps ensure the security of the Platform and the integrity of user interactions.

#### 4. Data Retention and Deletion

4.1 **User Settings Data**\
Data related to your nickname, avatar, and social accounts is stored on our servers. You can modify or delete this information at any time by accessing your account settings on the Platform.

4.2 **No Retention of Personal Data**\
CoinLucks does not store any personal data such as email addresses or financial information. We only store user profile settings (nickname, avatar, social account links) for as long as you choose to maintain them on the Platform.

4.3 **Blockchain Data**\
Blockchain transaction data (wallet addresses, transaction history) is stored on the respective blockchain network and is publicly accessible. CoinLucks does not control the storage or deletion of blockchain data.

#### 5. Third-Party Services

5.1 **Social Media Integrations**\
CoinLucks allows you to link your social media accounts (e.g., Telegram, Twitter) to your profile. These services may collect data according to their own privacy policies, which you should review before using these integrations. CoinLucks does not store any of your social media account credentials.

5.2 **Blockchain Network**\
Transactions are recorded on the blockchain and may be visible to others depending on the blockchain network's transparency. CoinLucks cannot control how blockchain data is handled or stored once a transaction is made.

5.3 **Third-Party Service Providers**\
We may use third-party services to support Platform functionality (e.g., for transaction processing, analytics, etc.). These third parties may collect information as outlined in their respective privacy policies. CoinLucks does not share your personal data with third-party providers unless required by law.

#### 6. Security of Your Data

6.1 **Non-Custodial Platform**\
CoinLucks operates as a non-custodial platform, meaning that we do not store or manage your private keys or wallet information. You are solely responsible for securing your wallet and its associated data.

6.2 **Protection of Profile Settings**\
We use standard security measures to protect user settings such as your nickname, avatar, and social account links. However, due to the decentralized nature of blockchain and our non-custodial model, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of all data on the Platform.

6.3 **Blockchain Security**\
The blockchain network itself is secure, but users must be cautious of potential risks related to blockchain technology and cryptocurrency transactions. It is recommended to take steps to protect your wallet and private keys.

#### 7. Your Rights and Control

7.1 **Control Over Your Data**\
You have control over your profile settings, including your nickname, avatar, and linked social accounts. You may update or delete this information at any time through the Platformâ€™s settings page.

7.2 **Blockchain Transparency**\
Please note that all blockchain transactions are publicly recorded on the respective blockchain and cannot be deleted. While CoinLucks does not collect personal data, your blockchain wallet address and transaction history will be visible on the blockchain.

#### 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

CoinLucks reserves the right to modify or update this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your information.

8.1 **No Notice Requirement**\
