## Staking Calculator Guide

### How It Works
The staking calculator helps you estimate potential rewards based on your staking inputs and current pool conditions.

- **Reward Estimation**: Calculates your potential staking rewards based on the current pool size, staking amount, and staking duration.
- **APR (Annual Percentage Rate)**: Provides an estimated annual return (APR) based on a 14-day reward cycle.
- **Early Unstake Fee**: A 5% fee is applied to rewards if staking is withdrawn within the 7-day lock-up period.

### Important Notes
- **Static Rewards**: Estimates are based on the current reward pool. New rewards added to the pool won’t update the estimate automatically.
- **Simplified Calculation**: Assumes rewards are distributed evenly over 14-day cycles and doesn’t account for changes in staking weight or historical reward adjustments.
- **Estimated vs. Actual**: The calculator provides rough estimates. Actual rewards may vary due to dynamic changes in the staking pool and live blockchain data.

This tool offers a convenient way to estimate your potential rewards but should not be relied upon for exact calculations.
