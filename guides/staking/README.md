# Staking

CoinLucks Staking Pools are smart contracts launched by the CoinLucks platform. They allow users to stake BNB to earn rewards while providing liquidity support for the game prize pool.

### Key Features

1. **Staking and Rewards**
   * Users can stake BNB to start earning rewards.
   * Rewards are tied to the platform's game revenueâ€”the higher the game revenue, the greater the rewards users receive.
   * Staked funds also contribute to the game prize pool liquidity, improving the system's sustainability.
2. **Reward Calculation Formula**
   * $$\text{User Rewards} = \frac{\text{User Weighted Stake Amount}}{\text{Total Weighted Stake Amount}} \times \text{Total Reward Pool}$$
   * The reward pool is funded by:
     * A portion of game revenue.
     * 5% fees from early unstaking.
3. **Reward Withdrawal and Compounding**
   * Rewards are released linearly over 14 days.
   * Users can choose to withdraw their rewards or compound them to increase their staked amount.
4. **Early Unstake Penalty**
   * The lock-up period is 7 days.
   * Early unstaking incurs a 5% fee, which is redistributed to the reward pool, benefiting other stakers.

### User Benefits and Risks

* **Benefits**
  * Rewards are directly proportional to game revenue, offering potentially high returns.
  * Compounding is supported, enabling long-term growth of staked funds.
* **Risks**
  * **Liquidity Risk:** Staked funds may be used to pay game winners, which could temporarily limit withdrawal availability.
  * **Market Volatility:** Fluctuations in BNB price could impact the value of rewards.

CoinLucks Staking provides a flexible and rewarding staking mechanism, empowering users while fostering the platform's growth.
